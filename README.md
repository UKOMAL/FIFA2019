# FIFA2019

  The data used for analysis comes from FIFA 2019. FIFA video games are soccer video games where a player can play as various real-life soccer teams. Our overall
  goal with this dataset was to be able to construct a model that will be able to predict a player’s value or wage using the attributes from the game.
  Essentially, we were looking at the relationship between attributes and how they impacted a player’s wage. 
  Were there certain attributes that are more important when it comes to wages? 
  Were there some that don’t really matter? 
  Ultimately if there is a brand-new player, using their attributes we should be able to give a range for the value and the wage.
  The methods we used were Principal component analysis (PCA), Exploratory factor analysis (FA), Canonical correlation analysis (CCA), Multiple regression, and
  Correspondence Analysis.
